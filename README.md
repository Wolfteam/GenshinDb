### Translations

Currently the app supports English and Spanish (There are some folks working on a french / russian translation).
If you want to help me with the translations, i encourage you to check the following files:

* The main one (where all the data of the characters / artifacts / etc are stored):
[Main](https://github.com/Wolfteam/GenshinDb/blob/develop/assets/i18n/en.json)

* The general one (where common strings are stored [not related specifically to the game]):
[General](https://github.com/Wolfteam/GenshinDb/blob/develop/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb)

To translate the general one is very simple, create a copy of the file, keeping the keys and translate the values:
E.g (in spanish) : "dark" :"Oscuro"

The main one is where you will find all the data for all the weapons, artifacts, etc. 
To translate this file just create a copy of it and do the following:
There is a key called "key" for each character, weapon, etc, and this one does not require a translation, it's just there for convenience,
and the same applies here, just keep the keys and translate the values
E.g:  if I'm translating  "name": "Normal Attack"  to spanish it will look like this:  "name": "Ataque normal"

In this file, there are some translations (mainly for weapons) that look like this: "Increases DMG against enemies affected by Hydro or Pyro by {{0}}%",
The {{x}} is a placeholder and the value shouldn't be changed, but the position can be changed in the text.
